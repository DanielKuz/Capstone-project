    "Due the large number of visitors the park receives every day, an investor would like to know if the surrounding of the park would be a good place to build his restaurant. To answer this question, the investor will open his restaurant if there is a region, next to the park, with not too many competitors. If such area is available, he also wants to know if it is better to open an Italian, a vegetarian or a Japanese restaurant, the types of food he already invests in."

    "To answer the question proposed in the business problem, some location information will be required. First, it is necessary the latitude and longitude of the park. Due to its size, the center of the park will be used as reference for its location. The latitude and longitude were already identified using Google maps and is 41.882512, -87.718236. With the latitude and longitude of the park, the closest food venues will be identified through Foursquare API, with a radius of 2500 meters. This large radius was chosen due the size of the park. With a 2500 radius, we will assure that at least a five-block radius surrounding the park will be considered when looking for food venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "After collecting the data, the data will be reviewed and cleaned. A cluster analysis will be performed using the latitude and longitude of the venues to identify regions with lower density of food venues. The clusters will be plotted through using folium to make the visualization easier. If there is a low density region, the categories of the venues will be reviewed to see what are the most popular food types and a recommendation of a type of restaurant will be made based on the other types of restaurants available in the region selected."
